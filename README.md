# Cadetwriter
Developed as a by-product of the IBM 1620 Jr. project, the Cadetwriter is a general-purpose ASCII terminal.  It can be connected via RS-232 or USB to any mini, micro, mainframe, or replica computer as a terminal device.  A commercial quality IBM/Lexmark Wheelwriter 1000 was adapted by interposing a circuit board containing a Teensy 3.5 microcontroller between the typewriter's keyboard and motherboard.  Custom firmware controls the typewriter and communicates with the host computer.  To support the full ASCII character set, characters not on the printwheel are synthesized using overprinted characters and "period graphics".  The Cadetwriter can print up to 16cps and is a reliable, low-maintenance, low-cost substitute for Teletype, DECwriter, Diablo, Spinwriter, Imagewriter, etc. teleprinters.
